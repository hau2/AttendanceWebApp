# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Employees check in/out quickly with photo evidence — managers and admins have real-time, accurate attendance data — any company deployed in minutes with no IT support
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (implementation complete — pending human verification checkpoint)
Status: Checkpoint — awaiting human verification of full onboarding wizard end-to-end flow
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Plan 01-03 implementation complete; backend and frontend built without errors

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 27%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~6 min
- Total execution time: 17 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3 | 17 min | ~6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 7 min, 3 min, 7 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- One active shift per employee (not schedule-based) — keeps v1 simple
- No in-system correction request flow — Admin adjusts directly with audit trail
- No notifications in v1 — manual dashboard monitoring sufficient
- IP mode configurable per company (log-only vs enforce-block)
- Photos visible to Admin and Manager only; employees see their own only
- No face recognition in v1 — photo-as-evidence without AI
- Service-role key on backend bypasses RLS — never exposed to frontend (01-01)
- Anon key on frontend is subject to RLS — enforces tenant isolation at DB layer (01-01)
- JWT app_metadata.company_id used as RLS claim — populated in auth.admin.createUser() during registration (01-02)
- SupabaseModule is @Global() — injectable anywhere in NestJS without re-import (01-01)
- Non-httpOnly cookie for access_token — Next.js Edge middleware cannot read httpOnly cookies (01-02)
- Atomic registration uses sequential operations with manual rollback — Supabase Auth Admin API and DB are independent systems (01-02)
- tsconfig @/* alias points to ./src/* — app/ is at root but source utilities live under src/ (01-02)
- Timezone saved via PATCH /company/settings in step 1, POST /onboarding/complete handles shift + user + onboarding_complete flag (01-03)
- OnboardingService manual rollback: if public.users insert fails, auth user is deleted to prevent orphaned records (01-03)
- catch (err: unknown) pattern used throughout — TypeScript strict mode compliance (01-03)

### Pending Todos

- Apply SQL migrations to Supabase before running backend (manual step — see 01-01-SUMMARY.md)
- Run 002_shifts_table.sql migration in Supabase SQL editor before testing onboarding wizard
- Copy backend/.env.example to backend/.env with Supabase credentials, JWT_SECRET, FRONTEND_URL
- Copy frontend/.env.example to frontend/.env.local with Supabase credentials and NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
- Human verification of onboarding wizard end-to-end flow pending (01-03 checkpoint)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
